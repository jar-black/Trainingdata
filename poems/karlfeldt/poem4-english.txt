Nocturne

Night falls upon the valley,
the stars are lit on high,
the moon sails through heaven's alley
like a ship across the sky.

Still the forest, still the meadow,
only the brook flows soft and slow,
the birds sleep in their shadow,
the wind's whisper is all to know.

At my window here I sit,
and gaze into the night so blue,
and my heart beats softly, bit by bit,
for what was and what ensue.

Memories come creeping
like shadows through the room,
they whisper of days now sleeping,
they speak but are consumed.

O night, you silent comforter,
you wrap around my grief,
within your dark arms I prefer
to rest as in God's relief.
