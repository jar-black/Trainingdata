Dalecarlian Frescoes in Rhyme

Upon the cottage wall they hang,
the old Dalecarlian paintings,
with their vivid colors' clang
and their biblical faintings.

There rides King David on his ass,
there dances Salome her dance,
there Samson smites the Philistine mass,
and Ruth stands in the corn's expanse.

They tell the ancient stories true
in red and blue and gold,
they speak of sin and grace anew
and God's patience, as of old.

My grandfather painted them,
and his father before him,
and so the art flows stem to stem
through generations within.

I sit and gaze upon the scenes
in evening's quiet peace,
and the old tales with their ancient themes
live on and never cease.
