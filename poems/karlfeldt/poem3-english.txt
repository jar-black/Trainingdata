Fridolin's Song

Fridolin is my name,
a farmer's son from Dalecarlia,
I wander through each land and claim
and sing to keep my spirits higher.

My fiddle is my bread and home,
my song is my reward,
I play for dance wherever I roam
at market and festive board.

I know each farm and cottage small,
I know both folk and beast,
I know where lives the widow tall,
and where fair maidens feast.

I am a free and happy man,
I own no more than these:
what my fiddle give me can
and what my voice may please.

So let me wander, let me sing,
from parish unto town,
for song is my joy's eternal spring,
my ever-green renown.
