The Rhyme-Smith

I am a smith of rhyme and verse,
I hammer words upon the anvil's stone,
I shape the phrases, strong and terse,
with mind so sharp and heart well-known.

My anvil is the paper white,
my hammer is my pen of ink,
I strike and strike with all my might
till words that sing and burn are linked.

I take the raw ore of life's own field,
I melt it in emotion's fire,
from it I forge what songs may yield
and images that all admire.

It is my craft, my profession true,
to give the spoken eternal form,
to capture life's emotion through
in verses that outlast the storm.

So I labor day and night,
the lonely poet at his trade,
until the poem stands alight
and sings its song, forever made.
