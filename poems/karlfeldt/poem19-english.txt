Sub Luna

Beneath the moon, in night's stillness,
I wander alone through woods and field,
my heart filled with strange gentleness,
my soul so open, bright, and healed.

The moon casts its silver light
over trees and mountain and dale,
and the night is like a quiet site
where all dreams tell their tale.

I think of those I have loved,
of those who went before me,
of all the life that I have approved
and that has blessed me thoroughly.

Beneath the moon I feel so near
to those no longer here on earth,
as if they whispered, taught me clear
all that has eternal worth.

And so I walk home when dawn draws nigh,
with a heart full of peace,
for beneath the moon's light on high
all sorrow finds release.
