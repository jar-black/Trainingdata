Autumn Song

Autumn has come to the valley,
the leaves fall down like gold,
mist rises from the alley
and the day grows short and cold.

The birds fly toward the southern clime,
the harvest is stored in the barn,
the farmer rests in peaceful time
and counts the year's rich yarn.

It is time to gather and to save,
to fill the stores for winter's cold,
to remember goodness that life gave
and forget the bitter tales of old.

Autumn has come to the valley,
soon snow will cover the ground,
but in my heart burns gently
a fire that keeps me sound.

So let autumn come with its winds so chill,
with its cold and driving rain,
I have memories that hold me still
to light and summer's golden reign.
