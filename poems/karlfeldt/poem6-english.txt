The Wood-Nymph

She comes on moonlit nights,
the wood-nymph with silver gaze,
she dances with steps so light
through winds that swiftly blaze.

Her hair is long as midnight,
her voice like the brook's own ring,
he who hears her song knows right
it's not a mortal thing.

She lures the young lads away
from their safe and cozy beds,
she leads them through woods astray
to her enchanted meadow spreads.

There they dance the whole night through
in the moon's pale gleaming light,
till morning's first rays break through
and send them home from their plight.

But he who has danced with the wood-nymph fair
shall never forget her more,
his heart will always yearn for her there,
for her whom none see before.
