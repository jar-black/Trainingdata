Dream and Life

The dream is a winged horse
that carries me from earth's course,
it lifts me up on wings so free
to heights where no chains bind me.

Life is a gray and heavy
companion who makes me old and steady,
it teaches me labor's strict decree
and duty's silent blow for blow to be.

But the dream comes every night
and gives me back what life took away,
it gives me youth and hope so bright,
it gives me longing, love to stay.

So I live two lives in one,
one heavy, one light and done,
one gray with the dust of day,
the other bright as morning's ray.

And when one day I cease to dream,
then life will also cease to stream,
for what keeps the heart alive
is the dream of a freer life to strive.
