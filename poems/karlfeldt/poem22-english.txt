The Milky Way

I gaze up at the Milky Way,
that shining band of light,
millions of stars in bright array
stretching far beyond my sight.

Where does that road so wide lead,
to what distant worlds unknown?
What lives there, what's there to heed
beyond the human zone?

I feel small as a grain of sand
on the shore of eternity's sea,
my time is brief, a moment spanned
between cradle and grave for me.

And yet, when I look toward space,
I'm filled with wonder grand,
that I may take my humble place
in creation's chorus band.

O Milky Way, you shining streak,
you show me infinity,
and I understand, though words are weak,
my place in the mystery.
