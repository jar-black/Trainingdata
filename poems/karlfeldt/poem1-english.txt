Song of the Wilderness

I hear the wilderness's call,
it summons me to the forest's hall,
where the river sings its eternal song
and the pines sway gently all day long.

There cries the hawk's wild lament,
there runs the roe deer, shy and content,
there shines the northern lights in winter night
and the midnight sun in summer's bright.

O wilderness, my heart's true land,
your beauty binds my spirit's hand,
your freedom lures me from city and bane
to your free and open domain.

Let me lie on the mossy bed,
let me drink from the brook's cool spread,
let me sleep beneath the stars' tent wide
and wake up free, by sunlight's tide!
