The Virgin Mary

Virgin Mary, mild and pure,
you sit with the child in your arms,
in the picture in the church so sure
you shine like the star's alarms.

The old farmers prayed to you
in sorrow's and in need's own hour,
they believed that you would help them through
life's deepest pit and power.

Your gaze is soft and warm,
your countenance full of peace,
you reach out your open arm
to all whose troubles never cease.

O Virgin Mary, queen of heaven,
you mother of all that lives,
in your grace and blessing given
the heart finds what it gives.

So you shine through the centuries,
a light in darkness' night,
and those who suffer and confide in these
find in you their treasure bright.
