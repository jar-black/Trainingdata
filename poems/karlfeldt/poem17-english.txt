Castle Unrest

There stands a castle on the mountain's crest,
they call it Castle Unrest,
there I wander when I cannot rest
when night is dark and I'm distressed.

Its walls are built of anxious dread,
its towers of worry and of woe,
its halls are filled with longing spread
and stairways of choices high and low.

I walk from room to room within,
I seek a door that leads outside,
but all lead to the same chagrin,
to the same unrest, where troubles bide.

Only when dawn fills my windowpane
and the sun rises over the wood,
the castle fades like a monster's bane
and I find peace, as I knew I would.

But the next night it's there once more,
the waiting Castle Unrest so near,
and I know I must walk that floor
that leads to where no dreams appear.
