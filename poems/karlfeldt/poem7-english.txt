The Autumn Orchis

The autumn orchis blooms by the roadside,
the last flower of summer's display,
she nods so quietly in autumn's stride
and says farewell in her pale array.

When all the others have withered and fallen,
when the grass turns yellow and leaves decay,
then she stands alone, enduring all of them,
the autumn storms that blow her way.

So it is with love within the heart,
it blooms when all else has gone away,
it holds out through sorrow's bitter art
and shines when darkness has its say.

O autumn orchis, you brave flower,
you teach me faithfulness and patience true,
to stand fast in the stormy hour
and keep my courage through and through.
