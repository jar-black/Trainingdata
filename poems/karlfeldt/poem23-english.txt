Autumn Hymn

Lord, autumn has arrived today,
the harvest is in, the fields lie still,
we thank you for all that you display
and give us from the earth's goodwill.

Thanks for the grain and for the bread,
for fruit that we have gathered in,
for all that keeps us fed
and gives us strength within.

Now the days grow dark, the evenings fall,
soon winter will spread its cover white,
but we know that spring will answer the call
and life will wake in hedge's delight.

So let us rest now in peace,
in gratitude for the year gone by,
and wait for the time when darkness cease
with faith and hope beneath the sky.

Lord, bless our humble dwelling place,
our loved ones and all we hold dear,
give us in winter stillness and grace
until spring returns, bright and clear.
