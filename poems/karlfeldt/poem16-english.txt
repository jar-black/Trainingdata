From the Crayfish Catcher's Song

We row out in the twilight hour,
with traps and bait within our boat,
we set them in the misty bower
where crayfish wait in waters remote.

The moon rises over the lake,
the stars are twinkling bright and clear,
and we sit silent for the sake
of night's dark gift drawing near.

When morning dawns we pull them up,
the red ones glowing like flames of fire,
we boil them with dill to sup
and celebrate as our fathers' desire.

It is crayfish party, it is feast,
with schnapps and songs and laughter too,
we eat until we can no more at least
and dance till night is through.

So we live the summer's joy,
by lakes and forests, land so grand,
remembering traditions we employ
that bind us together, hand in hand.
