Harvest Moon

The harvest man walks through the fields,
his scythe gleaming in the sun,
he cuts down what the cornfield yields
and gathers till the work is done.

His back is bent from labor's weight,
his hands are hard from years of toil,
but his eyes shine bright with joy so great
for the rich harvest from the soil.

He thanks God for rain and sun,
for seeds that sprouted and that grew,
he prays for strength when day is done
for all the farmers true.

And when he goes to rest at night,
with harvest's scent upon his clothes,
he sleeps so deep, so sound, so right,
with dreams of next year's rows.

Such is the farmer's simple way,
in rhythm with the earth's own beat,
an endless give and take each day
from dawn to dusk, complete.
