Fridolin's Pleasure Garden

In Fridolin's garden grows
each herb and every flower,
there bees buzz, the cattle lows,
and apples ripen by the hour.

There I wander in the sun
among roses and the lilies,
and feel the earth that I walk upon
and the scent from chamomile and fillies.

Here I have planted with my hand
each bush and every tree,
here I have watered the sandy land
and made it green for all to see.

It is my paradise on earth,
my garden and my home,
here I have given my soul its worth
and tended it like precious stone.

O Fridolin's garden, bloom still more
when I have gone to rest,
let others walk this path before
and find here peace and what is best.
