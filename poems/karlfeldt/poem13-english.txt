My Forefathers

My forefathers' soil, you barren ground,
you stone and moss, and fir and pine,
you are my home, my only mound,
my childhood dreams' first borderline.

Here walked my father and his father's sire,
here they broke stones and cleared the land,
here they laid foundations to aspire
with sweat and toil, with working hand.

They built the cottages, they dug the ditches,
they planted trees for times to come,
they put their strength in these enriches
and gave their lives for this homestead's sum.

And now the heritage is mine to bear,
the land that they have left behind,
I shall protect it with utmost care
as they have done through all time's bind.

My forefathers' soil, I pledge to you my faith,
I shall not break this bond so true,
until the day when death's own wraith
lets me rest in the same earth too.
