Threnody

When one day I lie beneath the soil,
when the bell rings out my end,
what will you say of my life's toil,
what words will the priest's lips send?

Say not that I was a saint,
for I have sinned like all men do,
say not that I was one to faint,
for I have fought the whole way through.

Say only this: He loved this life,
he took it as it came,
he gave more than was his amid the strife
and walked his path without shame.

He loved the earth, he loved the forest,
he loved each living thing,
he was a friend to those who soar highest
and danced in life's own ring.

So lay me in the earth, my friends,
let the leaves fall on my grave,
and remember that death never ends
us all, but love survives the wave.
