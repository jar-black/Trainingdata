Love Song

My darling, you are like the summer,
you brighten up my days,
you are like the sun above the lumber,
you give me strength always.

When you laugh, the birds are singing,
when you smile, the meadow blooms,
when you walk past, leaves are bringing
themselves aside to give you room.

I love you more than words can tell,
more than I can express,
you are my heaven where I dwell,
you are my happiness.

Without you life is empty,
without you night is long,
with you all is plenty,
with you all is a song.

So take my hand and follow me,
through life, through good and bad,
and I shall love you eternally,
the truest love I've ever had.
