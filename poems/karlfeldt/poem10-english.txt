The Witch

They burned her on the pyre,
the poor old woman frail,
they said she was in league entire
with the devil's silent pale.

She could heal both cows and sheep,
she knew every herb that grew,
she helped the sick in slumber's keep
and did what she knew to do.

But the priest said: It is sorcery!
And the people cried: To the stake!
And so they lit the fire of decree
and burned her for darkness's sake.

Now she lies beneath a gray stone,
the wise old woman there,
and no one remembers her good work known
and no one her gentle care.

O people, so blind you are,
so afraid of what you don't understand!
You kill the good from near and far
because it's different from your hand.
