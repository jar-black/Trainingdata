The Farmers' Guild

The farmers gather at the guild,
in the great hall with its beams,
they come from every field
to celebrate their dreams.

They sit at tables long,
with beer and food galore,
they speak of harvests strong
and share each other's store.

The fiddler plays his tune,
the feet begin to stamp,
soon they dance around the room
in polska's wild tramp.

It is once a year
when farmers take their rest,
when they forget their toil and fear
and simply feel their best.

So it has been a hundred years,
so shall it ever be,
for the guild is where the farmer cheers,
its comfort and its glee.
