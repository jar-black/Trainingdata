In a Dalecarlian Village

In a village in Dalecarlia,
between mountain and the wood,
lie the farmsteads scattered
along the old road where they stood.

The cottages are painted red,
with corners trimmed in white,
their roofs are covered with gray shingles,
the winds that brush them day and night.

Here the people live simply,
as their fathers did of yore,
they work the land, they tend the cattle,
as folk have always done before.

They dance their traditional dances,
they sing their ancient songs,
they hold fast to tradition
where their heritage belongs.

In a village in Dalecarlia
my heart has found its home,
where my forefathers wandered,
where one day I shall end my roam.
