The Horn of Autumn

Hear how the autumn horn sounds
over forest and over field,
it calls and it surrounds
us for the wild hunt unconcealed.

The hound barks in the wood,
the horse stamps, eager, tense,
the hunter sits where he stood
with his rifle, ready, intense.

It is the year's last hunt,
before winter lays its cover,
and nature gives its final brunt
in colors red like none other.

The horn sounds, the echo replies
from mountains and hills all around,
and the hunter onward flies
on paths he has long since found.

So autumn ends its story
with horns and with hounds that call,
and we carry home our quarry
to the winter evening's hall.
