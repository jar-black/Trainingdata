The Hunter Boy

The hunter boy walks through the forest,
with his rifle on his shoulder hung,
he knows each path and thicket purest,
he knows where the fox makes its den among.

He woke at the hour of dawning,
when mist lay heavy on the ground,
he went out in the gray of morning
to seek where game is found.

He listens to the forest's voices,
he reads the tracks upon the snow,
he knows where the moose makes choices,
and where the hare decides to go.

His eye is sharp as the eagle's,
his foot is light as the roe deer's stride,
he is a child of forest's legals,
of wilderness and nature's pride.

And when he comes home in the evening,
with his quarry on his back,
he sings a song of believing,
a free and happy, blessed track.
