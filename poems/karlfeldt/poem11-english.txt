Flower Song

The flowers sing within my garden,
each one its own melody,
the rose sings of love's sweet pardon,
the tulip of joy, running free.

The lily sings of purity and grace,
the violet of modest charm,
the sunflower sings of sunny place,
and primrose of spring's warm arm.

I walk and listen to their song
among the beds and borders bright,
and their music makes the day so long
into a feast of scent and light.

O flowers, you are earth's own poets,
you speak without a word,
you tell of life's secrets, and one knows it,
in color and form, undeterred.

So sing, sing on, my dearest friends,
from spring to autumn's end,
and I shall listen till the sun descends
and winter's breath does rend.
