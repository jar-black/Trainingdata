The Market

It is market day in the village,
with stalls and tables along the street,
with traders from every village
and folk from every district meet.

Here fabrics and tools are sold,
here cows and sheep are traded,
here songs are sung, both new and old,
and dances under birches shaded.

The farmer haggles and buys,
the wife chooses with care,
the children run with joyful cries
among the toys so fair.

The smell of sausage and coffee,
of honey and gingerbread,
the sound of laughter, happy and free,
when friends meet and are fed.

So it has been for a hundred years,
so shall it always be,
for the market in our village appears
as life itself for you and me.
