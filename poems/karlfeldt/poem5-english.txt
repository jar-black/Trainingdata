The Charcoal Burner's Daughter

She lived in a hut deep within the forest,
the charcoal burner's daughter, brown and slight,
she watched the charcoal pit through night's chorus
and sang her lonely song in pale moonlight.

Her hands were black with soot and coal,
her cheeks were red from the fire's glow,
but her eyes were clear as the spring's pure soul
and her heart was true, this much I know.

The wealthy farmers' sons came by,
they wanted her to be their bride,
but she shook her dark head with a sigh
and said no to their wooing pride.

"I want no gold and I want no farm,
I will not leave my forest home,
I'll tend my coal pit, sing my charm,
and live as I have always done, alone."

So she stayed by her charcoal pit,
the beautiful charcoal burner's child,
and her song rose to the stars, every bit,
through the forest's dark portals, free and wild.
