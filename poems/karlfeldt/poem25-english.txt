A Winter Evening

Snow falls silently on the rooftops,
candles glow in every cottage,
smoke rises, curling, never stops,
the village rests in winter's cottage.

Inside by the warm hearth's fire
the family gathers all together,
the children read, the father's lyre,
mother knits through winter weather.

Outside the wind screams wild,
outside the cold night reigns,
but in here all is mild
and warm as summer's remains.

The clock ticks upon its shelf,
the cat purrs on its stool,
and stories we tell ourselves
fill the evening, jewel by jewel.

So simple is true happiness,
a home, a fire, a circle dear,
and winter's cold harsh press
can never make that joy disappear.
