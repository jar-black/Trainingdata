Old-Fashioned Christmas

Do you remember Christmas old,
with trees and candles in every nook,
with gingerbread men so sweet to behold
and elves who tiptoed as they took?

Then all the family came to the farm,
from nearby and from lands afar,
they sat around the table's charm
and held each other's hands like star.

We sang our ancient Christmas songs,
we ate lutefisk and Christmas ham,
we danced around the tree in throngs
until the night was close at hand.

And the elf came with his sack so full,
with gifts for everyone there,
and the children laughed with gleeful pull
at all their presents fair.

O Christmas old, you live on still
in memory of days long past,
and I shall tell my children until
they know how it was at last.
