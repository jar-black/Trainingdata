The Dog and the Philosopher

A dog walks by.
He doesn't know he is a dog.
He doesn't know he is walking by.
He just walks.

A philosopher sees the dog.
He knows it is a dog.
He knows it is walking by.
He ponders what it means.

And the dog continues to walk
and the philosopher continues to ponder
and neither of them will ever know
which of them is right.
