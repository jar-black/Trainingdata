Litany

We asked for bread and received stones.
We asked for fish and received snakes.
We asked for love and received hate.
We asked for peace and received war.

But we continued to ask.
And one day, when we no longer asked,
when we had given up,
the rain fell on our dry fields
and bread grew from the stones.
