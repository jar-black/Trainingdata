The Snow

The snow falls slowly
over the sleeping houses.
The snow settles quietly
on the ground and on the roofs.

The snow knows nothing about us.
The snow knows nothing about our sorrows.
The snow only falls
as it always has done.

And we stand at the window
and watch the snow falling
and think about everything
that we have lost.
