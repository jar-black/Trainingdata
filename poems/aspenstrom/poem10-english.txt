The Shadows

The shadows on the wall move slowly.
They dance a dance I don't understand.
They tell a story
in a language I don't know.

Still I sit and watch them,
hour after hour,
and try to understand
what they want to tell me.

And when the sun goes down
and the shadows disappear
I still don't know
what they were trying to tell.
