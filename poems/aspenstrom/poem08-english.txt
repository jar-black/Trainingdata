The Simple

I wanted to write about the complicated
but found only the simple.
I wanted to describe eternity
but found only the moment.

I wanted to catch the stars
but found only the dust in the sunbeam.
I wanted to reach the highest
but found only the lowest.

And in the lowest I found everything.
In the dust I found the stars.
In the moment I found eternity.
In the simple I found the complicated.
