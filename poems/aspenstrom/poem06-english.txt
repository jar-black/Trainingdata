In the Moment

Everything happens in the moment.
Before and after don't exist.
There is only now,
this single now
that is all there is.

And in this now
the entire universe fits,
all stars and all planets,
all love and all sorrow,
all that was and all that shall come.

The moment is everything.
And we miss it
every time we think of before
or worry about after.
