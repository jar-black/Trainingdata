The Tree

I sit under a tree
and listen to the leaves.
They talk about the wind,
they talk about the sun,
they talk about the clouds drifting by.

But they never talk about me.
I am too small,
too insignificant
in the leafy bower under the tree.

And yet I sit here
and listen to the leaves,
for what else do I have to do
on this eternal afternoon?
