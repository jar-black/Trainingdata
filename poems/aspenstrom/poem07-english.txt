Morning

Morning comes with new promises.
The sun rises over the roofs.
The birds wake and start singing.
The world begins again.

But I lie still in bed
and wait for something to happen.
I wait for life to begin,
but life has already begun without me.

So I get up at last
and go out into the morning light
and try to catch up with life
that has already gone so far ahead.
