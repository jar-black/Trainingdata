To a Starfish

You know nothing about the sea
though you live in it.
You know nothing about the waves
that roll over you.
You know nothing about the moon
that pulls the tide.

You just live,
without knowing that you live,
without asking why.
And perhaps that is how
one should live:
without asking why.
