Words

I search for words
that can carry my thoughts.
But words are heavy,
they sink to the bottom
before they arrive.

I search for words
that are light as feathers,
that can fly where I want,
but those words have not been invented yet.

So I use the words I have,
the heavy, the clumsy ones,
and hope that someone understands
what I am trying to say.
