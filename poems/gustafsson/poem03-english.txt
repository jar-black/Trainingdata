The Silence in a House

There is a silence in an empty house
that is different from all other silence.
It is denser, heavier,
it carries all the voices that once were here.

I walk through the rooms and listen.
I hear echoes of laughter and crying,
of conversation and quarrels and love.
The walls remember everything.

And when I go out again
I carry the silence with me
like a stone in my pocket,
heavy with all memories.
