The Missing

There is always something missing.
A word, a thought, a feeling.
Something that should have been said,
something that should have been done.

We live our lives in the margin,
in the space between the possible
and the real.
We never quite arrive.

But perhaps that is how it should be.
Perhaps it is precisely the missing
that drives us forward,
that makes us who we are.
