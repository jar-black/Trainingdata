Afternoon in April

The light falls in through the window.
It is afternoon in April.
The shadows are long and soft.
Time stands almost still.

I sit in the armchair and think
of nothing in particular.
The clock ticks on the wall.
The cat sleeps on the sofa.

This is happiness, I think.
Nothing more than this.
The light, the silence, the afternoon,
and nothing that needs to be done.
