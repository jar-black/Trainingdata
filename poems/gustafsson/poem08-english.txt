A Garden in Texas

There was a garden in Texas
where lemons grew all year.
There I sat under a tree
and read books I didn't understand.

The sun was hot and the air dry.
The fans hummed on the porch.
And I thought of Sweden,
of snow and darkness and cold.

Now I sit in Sweden
and think of that garden.
The lemons ripen without me.
The sun shines on an empty table.
