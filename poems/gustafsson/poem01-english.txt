The Balloon Travelers

We rise, we rise.
The earth sinks away beneath us.
The houses become small as toys,
the people like ants.

We rise toward the clouds,
we rise toward the stars,
we leave everything behind us:
the sorrow and joy and fear.

And up there, in the thin air,
nothing remains to hold on to,
nothing remains to lose,
only the infinite space.
