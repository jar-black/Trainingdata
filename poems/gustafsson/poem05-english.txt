The Philosophy of Small Joy

Great joy is rare.
It comes like a storm
and disappears just as fast.
But small joy,
it is everywhere.

In the scent of morning coffee,
in the sunbeam's dance on the floor,
in a child's laughter on the street,
in the first rain after drought.

Don't seek great joy.
It comes when it wants.
But small joy,
you can find every day,
if you only bother to look.
