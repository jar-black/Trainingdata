Elegy for a Lost Summer

Summer passed and I didn't see it.
I was occupied with other things.
The days passed like trains at a station
where I stood waiting for the wrong train.

Now it is autumn and leaves are falling.
Now it is cold and nights are long.
I sit by the window and remember
a summer I never had.

Next year, I tell myself.
Next year I will see summer.
But the years pass and summers flee
and I remain at the wrong station.
