At the Shore

At the shore I sit and watch
how the waves come and go.
They come and they go.
There is no end and no beginning.

I have sat here for hours.
I have sat here for years.
I have seen the sun rise and set
while the waves come and go.

And I understand that I am a wave,
that I come and go,
that there is no end and no beginning,
only the eternal movement.
