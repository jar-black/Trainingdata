Beyond Words

There is a place beyond words
where language cannot reach.
There live the deepest thoughts,
the strongest feelings.

I try to go there,
I try to find the way,
but every time I approach
the place disappears.

It only exists when I don't search.
It only comes when I forget.
And then, for a moment,
I know all that cannot be said.
