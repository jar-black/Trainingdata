The Silence of Machines

When the machines fall silent
all other sounds are heard.
The birdsong, the wind's whisper,
the heart's beat in the chest.

We have gotten used to the noise,
to the constant humming
that drowns everything else.
We have forgotten how silence sounds.

But sometimes, when the power goes out,
when the motors stop,
then the world returns
to its original state:
quiet and friendly and near.
