The Nameless and Immortal

I know not their names. I never heard
a ballad sung of them.
Not the memory of a single deed remains.
But it is them I see
when the sun sinks behind the mountains,
when twilight settles over earth,
when thirty thousand years
like smoke from the campfire's hearth
vanish before me.

The brother-peoples, they who never were beheld
by any living soul of earth's folk,
whose desert-march from age to age
knows no goal, whose viking-voyage
is lost in the limitless.
Of them I think when I think:
This is the eternal, the immortal,
and not that year from year.

Not them who conquered at Olympia,
they who won the heralds' praise,
they who got statues in Athens,
they who with shield and spear,
with laurel and the Olympic ivy's crown
went head and shoulders into songs—
no! not the many, thousands,
whose memory can so widely
around the earth extend—no!
Those without name, those without song.
