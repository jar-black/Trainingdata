I Dreamt of You One Night

I dreamt of you one night,
and when I wakened,
you were gone.

But thy countenance's features
and thy glance
and thy form
were left with me.

I have sought thee
day after day,
but thou art not.

Thou wert only a dream,
a fair dream,
that came and went.

But nevertheless thou livest
in my heart,
and I remember thee
as if thou hadst been real.

O thou, whom I dreamt!
O thou, who never wast!
Wherefore didst thou not become true?
Wherefore wast thou only dream?
