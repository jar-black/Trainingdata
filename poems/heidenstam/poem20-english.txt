Citizen John

John was a simple man,
a man whom none knew,
a man who lived quiet
and did his work.

He went to his work
each morning when the sun went up,
and he went home again
when the sun went down.

He was not rich, not mighty,
not famous and not noble.
He was quite simply John,
citizen John.

But when he died,
then wept all who knew him,
for he was a good man,
an honest man, a faithful man.

And the memorial over him
is not of marble or stone,
but in the hearts
that he touched.
