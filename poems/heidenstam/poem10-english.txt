Sweden

Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, fatherland,
our longing's home, our fathers' earth!
Thou thronest highest in our memories.
Thee love we, O land, O land,
from childhood years unto the grave.

Us lures neither silver nor gold,
it is our love for thy soil
that holds us together.
With thee we will live, gray forest,
and die with thee in our arms.

We remember how the fathers built
our land with their hands.
We remember their strife, we remember their peace,
and all the great things that they did
and all the beautiful that they created.

O fatherland, if we thee leave,
thy heaven and thy earth,
so bear we thee still in the soul.
Thy image we perceive
in all the memory we preserve.
