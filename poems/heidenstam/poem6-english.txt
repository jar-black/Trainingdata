The Wells of Ancient Beauty

Wherever on earth I have seen
the beautiful, I have always too
a deep and secret well beheld
beneath—
a well of sorrow.

Yes verily! The ancient word has its truth
that grief and beauty are sisters.
It is from sorrow beauty has risen,
from sorrow's fountain it has drunk,
of sorrow's nightly and black
and deep waters.

And yet beauty radiates
so bright and glad toward us!
And yet it sings its glad
and jubilant jubilee-song!

O, that the joy which radiates toward us
is sorrow-filled! O, that the song
which sounds gladdest has a tone,
a secret, dusky, deep and sorrowful,
that trembles like a premonition
of the pain from which it was born!
