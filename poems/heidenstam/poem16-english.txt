The King's Hunt

The king rides to hunt today,
with hounds and horns and huntsmen.
He rides through the forest,
he rides over the heath,
he rides thither where the stag goes.

The horns sound loud,
the hounds bark,
and the huntsmen call
that the king comes.

But the king rides silent
on his white horse.
He looks before him
with thoughtful glance.

What thinks the king on
when he rides to hunt?
Thinks he of the realm,
of the people, of the power?

No, the king thinks
of something quite other.
He thinks of life,
of death, of time
that flees so fast,
that none can check.
