The Birch Tree

There stood a birch by the wayside
so white and pure and fair.
It stood with green leaves,
that in the wind softly turned.

I stopped and looked
upon the white birch.
It was so beautiful and sweet,
as if it were more than a tree.

It was a memory from my childhood,
a memory I thought forgot.
But when I saw the white birch,
then I remembered again.

O birch! Thou white, fair one,
thou green, thou who growest
by the road where I walked as a child!
Thou art my fatherland,
thou art my childhood's land,
thou art my heart's memory!
