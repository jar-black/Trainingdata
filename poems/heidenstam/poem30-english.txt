The Dead

The dead sleep not.
They sleep never.
They wake in their silent darkness,
they wait, they long,
they remember.

They remember the life they lived,
they remember the light they saw,
they remember the love they felt.
And memory is their eternity.

We who live think we have forgot them,
we who live think they have forgot us.
But it is not true.
They forget us never,
and we forget them never wholly.

For the dead live in us,
the dead walk with us,
the dead speak to us
in our dreams and in our conscience.

The dead are not dead.
They live, they live eternally,
as long as we remember them.
