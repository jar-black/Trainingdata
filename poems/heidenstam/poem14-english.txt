When the Heart is Young

When the heart is young,
then is the whole world young,
then is the sun clearer,
then is the heaven bluer,
then is the grass greener
and the flower fairer.

When the heart is young,
then sings all around,
then is life easier,
then is sorrow shorter,
then is joy greater
and love deeper.

But when the heart ages,
then ages also the world.
Then becomes the sun dimmer,
then becomes the heaven grayer,
then withers the grass,
and the flower falls.

O youth! O youth!
Thou who art so brief,
so sweet and so precious!
Preserve in thy heart
that youth's fountain,
that never can dry up!
