Love's Steed

Love is a steed,
a wild and frolic steed,
that gallops through life
with the bridle's reins loose.

It gallops over mountains,
it gallops over valleys,
it gallops over paths
where none has trod before.

Try not to subdue it!
Try not to get the rein!
It gallops where it will,
and none can check it.

But he who sits fast
upon its back,
he gets a ride so wild,
so glorious and so fair,
that all what else there is
vanishes like a dream.
