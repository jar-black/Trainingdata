From Charles XII's Misfortunes

It was a morning cold and gray
when the king would away from Bender.
His men were weary and few,
and the enemy sent a thousand hands.

But the king smiled and drew his sword
and said: "Follow me, Swedish men!
We fight like lions for our honor
and come home to Sweden again."

And they fought like lions, each and every,
against the odds wild and hard.
They fought for the king and for the right,
they fought for Sweden's honor and guard.

But the odds were too great,
and the king must yield as captive.
But never forget Swedish men
that gray morning at Bender.
