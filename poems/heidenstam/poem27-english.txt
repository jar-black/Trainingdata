The Stork

The stork stands on the roof,
on the red roof,
and looks out over the region
with its wise eye.

He has come from the south,
from Africa's lands,
and he has returned
to his old nest.

Each spring he comes,
each autumn he flies away,
but always he comes back,
faithful and sure.

He is a sign,
a sign of faithfulness,
of homesickness,
of love for the old.

O stork! Thou faithful bird!
Thou who rememberest thy home
and always returnest!
Thou teachest us
what love is.
