The Pilgrims

We are whitening pilgrims,
with staff and sash and wreath
and hanging rosaries,
who linger by the wayside and rest.

We sing our song—
our glance looks backward—
long have we wandered
and the end is near.

Feel how warm
and glorious the noon sun is!
Feel how still and sweet
the grassy slope is!

There are no more days,
no time and no year.
There is no more spring
and no autumn.
There is only now,
this only sweet, long now.

We must rise and go.
We must leave the green
and our rest and our laughter,
rise and go
the last steps, the short steps,
that remain.

Farewell now, grassy slope!
Farewell now, warm sun!
Feel how good,
how still and how good,
our rest was!
