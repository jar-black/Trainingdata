The Clapper-Gate

I remember from my childhood
an old clapper-gate,
that stood where the road took a bend
by the field.

It stood there gray and large
with its wooden planks
and the bars and the latch
and the hinges of iron.

Now it is many years since,
and never went I thither again,
but the clapper-gate's image
is clear to my soul even today.

If you ask me: Wherefore?
so can I not answer you,
for nothing remarkable happened at that gate,
nothing at all.

But nevertheless I remember it
so clearly and so strongly,
as if that memory were
my heart's secret.
