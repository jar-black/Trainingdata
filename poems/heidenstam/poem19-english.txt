The Young Man to the Old

Thou old man with white locks,
thou who hast seen so much more than I,
thou who hast lived long,
thou who hast fought many battles,
what canst thou teach me?

Canst thou teach me to live?
Canst thou teach me to die?
Canst thou teach me what life's meaning is,
what death's secret?

The old one answers: "No, my son,
I can teach thee nothing.
For all what I have learned
through my long life,
that have I forgot.

I remember no longer
what I believed when I was young.
I remember no longer
what I fought for.

But one thing know I: that to live
is to forget,
and that to die
is to remember again."
