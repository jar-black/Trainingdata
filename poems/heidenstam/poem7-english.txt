Autumn's Death

Now autumn dies.
Now the grass withers and pales.
Now the clouds grow darker.
Now the leaves fall and wither.
Now the sun goes lower and lower
along the sky down.

How many autumns have died before!
How many autumns shall die!
It is always the same way,
the same journey toward winter's darkness.

But every autumn that dies
is nevertheless new and wonderful,
as if no autumn
had died before.

See now how the leaves fall!
It is as if they fell for the first time.
It is as if no autumn
had gone toward the darkness before.

Now autumn dies again.
Now it dies once more.
It dies and dies and dies,
eternally it dies
and is eternally young.
