The Grave of Conrad

What know I of my father
more than that his gravestone stands
among the cypresses in Montagnola?

What know I of his countenance more than what
I've seen on a gilded medallion
with gold leaf worn away?

And of his soul
what know I more
than that it was a dreamer's soul,
a soul that believed
in eternal life's mystery
and never in corruption's?

Now he lies in Montagnola
and the sun goes up and down
and up and down
over his grave,
and the day comes and goes
and comes and goes
forever,
and he knows it not more.

Yet! Perhaps he knows it.
Perhaps he still lives
in the light and in the wind,
in the flowers and the grass
and all that's beautiful.
