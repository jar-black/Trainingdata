The Day of Judgment

When the day of judgment comes,
when heaven opens
and the angels descend,
when the dead arise from their graves
and all gather for the judgment—

What shall then the judgment be?
Who shall then be acquitted
and who shall be condemned?

Tell me: He who loved much,
shall he be condemned for his sins,
or shall he be acquitted for his love?

Tell me: He who suffered much,
shall he get reward for his torments,
or shall he be punished for his complaining?

I know not what the judgment will be.
But one thing know I:
that love is greater than judgment,
and that mercy
is greater than justice.
