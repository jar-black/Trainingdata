The Trumpets

I am the trumpeter
who blows in a new day.
I stand on the tower high
and blow toward the morning.

My trumpet sounds clear
and strong and joyful.
It wakes them who sleep,
it calls them who wait.

I blow for a new kind of folk,
for new thoughts, new dreams,
for new ways forward
toward the light and toward life.

Hear ye my trumpet sound?
Hear ye how it calls you?
Rise up! Rise up from the slumber!
The new day dawns!

The new day comes
with sun and hope and song.
Rise up and meet it!
Rise up and live!
