When First the Spring

When first the spring came to our region,
when the snow melted away
and the ice in the stream broke,
when the grass began to grow
and the flowers began to sprout—

Then came also something other,
something that cannot be seen,
something that cannot be heard,
but that nevertheless is there:
Hope.

Hope for a new life,
hope for new days,
hope that all
shall become different,
shall become better.

It is this hope
that makes spring so fair,
that makes us love it so highly,
that makes us long for it
the whole winter long.

O spring! Thou time of hope!
Thou eternal time of renewal!
