The New Faith

There is a new faith,
a faith that is not old,
a faith that is not bound
by dogmas and by laws.

It is the faith in life itself,
in the light and in the joy,
in the beauty and the love,
in all what is good.

It is not the priests' faith,
not the church's faith,
not the books' faith,
but the heart's faith.

That faith is simple and clear
as the child's mind,
it is deep and strong
as life itself.

O, this new faith!
She shall one day
free the world
from the darkness and from the lies!
