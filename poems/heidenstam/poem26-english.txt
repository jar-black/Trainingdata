Far in the Sunset Glow

Far away in the sunset glow
I see a land,
a land I have never reached,
a land I never reach.

It lies there beautiful and alluring,
with golden mountains and valleys,
with streams of light
and forests of verdure.

I long for it,
I long eternally for it,
but it is always equally far away,
always equally unattainable.

Perhaps it is a land
that exists not,
perhaps it is only a dream,
a fair dream that lures.

But nevertheless I long,
nevertheless I see it there
far away in the sunset glow,
the land I never reach.
