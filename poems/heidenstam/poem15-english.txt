A Summer Night's Song

It is a summer night,
a sweet and bright and still summer night,
and all is quiet around.

The moon goes up over the forest,
and the stars are kindled one after one,
and the night becomes full of light.

It is so still, so wondrously still,
that I can hear my own heart beat,
that I can hear the blood
run through my veins.

It is a night for dreams,
a night for thoughts,
a night when all the great
and mysterious
comes nearer.

O summer night! O bright night!
Thou who art so fair,
so wonderful and so eternal!
In thee I feel
eternity's whisper.
