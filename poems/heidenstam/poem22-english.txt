To My Fatherland

O fatherland! O Sweden!
Thou land where I am born,
thou land where my fathers sleep,
thou land that I shall love
till my last moment!

I have seen other lands,
I have seen distant shores,
I have seen the south's sun
and the east's wonders.

But no land is to me so dear
as thou, my fatherland!
For thou art mine, and I am thine,
and we belong to each other
forever.

Thy heaven is my heaven,
thy earth is my earth,
thy people is my people,
and thy future is my future.

What ever may happen,
where ever I go,
so bear I thee
in my heart.
