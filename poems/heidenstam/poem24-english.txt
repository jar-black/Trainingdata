The Vernal Flock

Behold, the vernal flock comes!
Behold, how they fly,
the white birds,
northward, northward!

They come from the south,
from warm lands,
they come with spring's message,
with spring's song.

Hear how they call!
Hear their jubilation!
It is as if the whole air
were full of joy.

Now winter is ended,
now darkness is ended,
now comes the light,
now comes the spring!

Welcome, ye white birds!
Welcome, ye spring's messengers!
Ye tell us that life
is eternally young.
