At Persepolis

Here stood a palace,
here stood a stairway's last step remaining,
here is a pillar,
and pillar and step are white.
Here sat an empire
that seemed forever,
and here was the sound of the banquet's song
and the scent of fruits and the scent of wine
and the lyre and the kithara.

Where are they now,
they who sat at table with the banquet's song?
Where is now the wine, where is the fruit,
where is now the lyre and the kithara?

Where are all they who loved,
who sought, who found,
who were kissed and who kissed,
who were born and who died?

Where is now the laughter
and where is now the weeping?

Behold! Behold!
A single pillar that stands remaining
and a step, white and desolate.
