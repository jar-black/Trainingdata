Thy Thousand Years

Sweden! Thy thousand years
have gone like days.
Thy kings have come and gone,
thy wars have come and gone,
but thou endures.

Thou hast seen the vikings' marches,
thou hast seen the empire's days,
thou hast seen the defeat's years,
and thou hast seen the peace's time.

But through all this
hast thou remained the same,
with thy forests and lakes,
with thy mountains and valleys,
with thy people that never dies,
that always renews.

May thy thousand years
become ten thousand,
may thou live and flourish
till time's end!

Sweden! My fatherland!
Thou eternal, thou immortal!
