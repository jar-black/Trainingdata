Jacopone da Todi

How fair, how fair to die!
To crumble down to mould beneath
the dusky cypress! How fair
to lonely, forgot, vanish,
to be nothing more than dust,
to have all transformed, not even a slight
bone-remnant left in the grave!

How fair, how fair to die!
To know: It is ended!
No more daylight more, no more
the fair spring with its joy,
no flower more or the wind's sough!
No more hope, no bitter pain,
no temptation, no strife!

How fair, how fair to die!
To close oneself from all, to lonely
walk into the darkness and become naught,
to escape anguish more,
to escape tears, evil, lies,
to escape all!

O death's repose, thou white, mute one,
thou most wonderful of all
that exists here on earth!
