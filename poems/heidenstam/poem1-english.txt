Invocation

O Muse! my foam-born sister!
Thou only god, at whose altar
I trust and offer.
Thou, who with the Valkyrie's pale blue eye
and the cheek's roses
dost look as fair and young today
as thou didst look in the days of Hellas.
In thy cool grottoes of zephyrs and springs
my soul has its home.
Thou art the green
foliage without, the brooding shadow
and the white flower.

Thou art the beautiful
from my cradle on toward the grave.
Thou camest to meet me even when I was a child
and stoodst with snowy breast and bare
and didst lift me halfway toward the sun
and saidst: Behold!
Behold, all kingdoms are thine!
For he who loves me, he wins
the secret of eternal youth.
