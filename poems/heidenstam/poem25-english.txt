Tizian's Son in the Dungeon of the Inquisition

Here I sit in the darkness,
in the dungeon deep and cold.
I see not the sun more,
I see not the heaven more.

My father was a great artist,
he painted the beautiful,
he painted the light and the color
and all what life is.

But I, his son,
I sit here in the darkness,
condemned by the Inquisition,
for that I thought freely.

Yet! None can take from me
the memory that I bear
of the father's paintings,
of the light and of the color.

In the darkness I see the light,
in the prison I see freedom,
for art is immortal,
and beauty can no
chain bind.
