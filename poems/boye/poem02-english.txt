Yes, Of Course It Hurts

Yes, of course it hurts when buds are breaking.
Why else would the spring hesitate?
Why would all our heated longing
be bound in the frozen bitter pale?
The bud was the sheath all winter.
What new thing is it that consumes and bursts?
Yes, of course it hurts when buds are breaking,
hurts for that which grows
                and that which shuts.

Yes, it is hard when drops are falling.
Trembling with fear they hang heavy,
cling to the twig, swell, slide—
loosen and fall, yet longing still carries.
Hard to be unsure, afraid and divided,
hard to feel the deep draw and call,
yet sit there still and only tremble—
hard to want to stay
                and want to fall.

Yes, of course it hurts when buds are breaking.
Hurts for that which grows and that which shuts.
But the spring, which is the hard road,
it is what leads home to meadows.
It is toward the bright, it is toward the clear,
it is toward the mild, it is toward the warm.
It is toward the fields where sunlight streams,
sunlight warms, sunlight fills all our dreams.
