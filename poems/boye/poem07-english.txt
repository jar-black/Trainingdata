Harvest

It ripens in me,
it ripens in me like grain in a field.
I don't know what it is,
but it ripens.

One day it will be harvested.
One day it will be gathered.
One day it will become bread
for someone who hungers.

I wait for the harvester.
I wait for the day
when all that has ripened in me
will be carried home.
