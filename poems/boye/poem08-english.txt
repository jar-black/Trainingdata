Oh, If Only One Could

Oh, if only one could be faithful,
faithful to just one thing!
Oh, if only one could be soaked through
by a single thought's bath!

Oh, if only one had grip on life,
had firm and steady ground!
One who knew what one wanted,
knew what one had left!

But we search and we wander,
always hungry and tired.
And we never find the way
home to what we have lost.
