The Night

The night is my friend.
She wraps me in her darkness.
She whispers secrets in my ear.
She shows me the stars.

The night is my enemy.
She brings nightmares and anguish.
She doesn't let me sleep.
She reminds me of all I want to forget.

The night is my lover.
She embraces me and holds me fast.
She doesn't release me until dawn comes.
And then I cry.
