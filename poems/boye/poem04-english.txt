You Are My Purest Comfort

You are my purest comfort, my deepest worry.
Like the sky you turn away and toward me.
You are my daily safety, my daily danger.
You are my great secret
and my open word.

You are the darkness that shows the light.
You are the silence that gives voice to song.
You are the doubt that creates faith.
You are the bonds that give me wings.

You are my purest comfort, my deepest worry.
You are all that I seek
and all that I flee.
