The Stars

We are made of stardust, they say.
We are children of the sun and the night.
We carry the universe in our veins,
galaxies in our eyes.

And yet we feel so small,
so lost and alone.
We forget that we are stars
that have fallen down to earth.

One day we will remember.
One day we will see
that we have always been light,
only covered by darkness.
