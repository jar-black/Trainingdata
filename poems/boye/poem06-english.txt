My Skin Is Full of Butterflies

My skin is full of butterflies
with folded wings.
They wait. They rest.
They dream of flight.

But one day they will wake,
one day they will fly,
one day they will leave
my body and my skin.

And I will stand empty
like an abandoned shell,
and watch them fly away
toward the horizon.
