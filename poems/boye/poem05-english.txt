The Best Ones

The best cannot describe what they have seen.
They search for words but find only
the simple things each day. Their eyes know.
And where they've gone the sun has shadowed gray.

The best are silent and leave again
where no path can follow their trail.
They hear another gain, another song,
they carry another world in their wounds.

The best seek no one to understand.
They know that words can never reach.
They carry their treasure in silence and go
their way toward the horizon, quiet, solemn.
