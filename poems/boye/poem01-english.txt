In Motion

The sated day is never first in worth.
The best of days is a day of thirst.

Yes, there is goal and meaning in our path—
but it's the way that is the labor's worth.

The best goal is a night-long rest,
where fire is lit and bread is quickly pressed.

In places where you only sleep one night,
sleep is secure and dreams are full of light.

Break up, break up! The new day dawns so free.
Infinite is our great adventure's sea.
