The Tree

I am a tree that carries a thousand leaves,
where the wind sings of its longing.
I am a tree that draws nourishment
from the dark depth without a name.

I stand here firmly with roots in the earth
and stretch my arms toward the sky.
I know where I belong,
I know what I am.

I am a tree. I sing
with my thousand leaves in the wind.
I draw life from the darkness
and give it to the light.
