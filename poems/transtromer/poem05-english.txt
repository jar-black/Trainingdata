Fire-Jottings

During the dismal months my life sparkled only when I made love with you.
As the firefly ignites and fades, ignites and fades,
– by glimpses we can trace its path
in the night darkness among the olive trees.

During the dismal months the soul sat shrunken and lifeless
but the body took the straight way to you.
The night sky was lowing.
We milked the cosmos on the sly and survived.
