Thaw

The morning's transparent rage.
The wind runs bandy-legged in the snow.
I see it through the window in the twilight camp.
It seems to sprint and stands still.
The forest's timber is waterlogged.
The graveyard has sunk down into the earth.
Gray sky and black earth
in an atmosphere of love.
The trees take a step toward me.
They have snow on their shoulders.
I am the only one who is sleepless.
A hundred windows have awakened in me.
I recognize too little, too little.
But my lifelong love
is constantly present, invisible
like radioactivity in the mountain's interior.
