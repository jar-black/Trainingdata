Baltics

There is an underwater world of green-brown light
that is forest in the sea,
that is forest above the water – inverted.

All that was lost remains.
I swim as in a dream.
I swim in my childhood.

The surface of the sea is desolate.
Swell and swell.
But under the water it is calm,

the trees stand still there.
There I swim.
I swim in my childhood.
