Allegro

I play Haydn after a black day
and feel a simple warmth in my hands.

The keys are willing. Gentle hammers strike.
The tone is green, lively and calm.

The tone says that freedom exists
and that someone doesn't render unto Caesar.

I shove my hands into my Haydn pockets
and imitate someone who looks calmly at the world.

I hoist the Haydn flag – it means:
"We won't give up. But want peace."

The music is a glass house on the slope
where the stones fly, the stones roll.

And the stones roll right through
but each pane remains whole.
