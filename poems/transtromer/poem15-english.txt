Short Pause in the Organ Concert

The great door flew open and the organ storm
went straight out among the passersby. No one stopped.
The sunshine blazed behind like a thunderstorm
and every human had their cross in their afterthought.
So I left the church, changed,
with the sea of music inside me. I sat down
by the streaming light and listened
with all of me to the murmur of streets. How long
has that storm been going on? Before we know it
we have passed through and entered another city.
