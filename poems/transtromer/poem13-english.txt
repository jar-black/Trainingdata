Vermeer

It is no safe world, no, exactly there where safety rests
behind the wall where the Woman with the Balance
hangs a darkened field, a field that won't bear,
a landscape for refugees.

Like sheltering life it is, that crowd
gathered at the table's end. You speak to her
with your eyes. The wordless is the only thing
that bears, the dim a kind of safety.

Against the table presses the chair, the chair presses
against the body sitting on it.
The light is not screaming but filters
through the openings with the finely-tuned scale pan.

And her face: a silent day
water in a glass held in the hand,
held by no one, held by herself:
the calm woman with the balance.
