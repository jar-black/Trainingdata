Nocturne

I drive through a village at night, the houses rise up
in the headlight beams – they're awake, they want to drink.
Houses, barns, signs, abandoned vehicles – now
they're putting on Life. – The people are sleeping:

some can sleep peacefully, others have tense faces
as if they were in the middle of hard training for eternity.
They don't dare to let go though sleep is heavy.
They rest like lowered barriers while the mystery rushes past.

Outside the village the road glows far among tree trunks.
It glows in black and white. And stones shine
in the fields with a pitiful white light – stones spread out
as if they were planets emerging from death.
