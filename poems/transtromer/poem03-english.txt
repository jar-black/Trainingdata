Track

Two a.m.: moonlight. The train has stopped
out in the middle of the plain. Far away, points of light in a town,
flickering cold at the horizon.

As when someone has gone into a dream so deep
she'll never remember having been there
when she returns to her room.

And as when someone has gone into an illness so deep
that all his days become a few flickering points, a swarm,
cold and sparse at the horizon.

The train stands completely still.
Two o'clock: bright moonlight, few stars.
