Torches and Bleachers

There are no faces on them,
they drift around like flags in a quagmire,
what leads them to the goal
is the inviolable will.

I sleep and wake. It rains outside.
My thoughts drift around
but my will is unshakable
it works while I sleep.

And the flowers sleep while time rises,
the first snow falls, the last leaves
dangle like exhausted butterflies.
There are no faces on them.
