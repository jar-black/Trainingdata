Black Postcards

I

The diary's written full, future unknown.
The cable hums the folk song with no homeland.
Snowfall on the lead-still sea. Shadows
wrestle on the quay.

II

Midway in life it happens that death comes
and takes the measure of man. This visit
is forgotten and life goes on. But the suit
is being sewn in silence.
