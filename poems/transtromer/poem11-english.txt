Grief Gondola

I

Two old men, father-in-law and son-in-law – Liszt and Wagner – live on the Grand Canal
together with the restless woman who is married to King Midas,
she who was sent as a gift from Weimar.
Heavy intelligentsia in the palazzo where the rats scamper briskly behind the wall panels.
The gondola is heavily laden with their lives, two round trips and a return ticket.

II

A window in the palazzo flies open and one grimaces in the sudden draft.
Outside on the water the garbage gondola foams forward driven by two bandits with one oar each.
Liszt has written down some chords that are so heavy that they should be sent
to the mineralogical institute in Padua for analysis.
Meteorites!
Too heavy to rest, they can only sink and sink through the future all the way down
to the Brahms years.
The gondola is heavily laden with the crouching stones of the future.
