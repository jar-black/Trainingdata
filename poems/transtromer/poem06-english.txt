Morning Birds

I wake the car
whose windshield is covered with pollen.
I put on my sunglasses.
The birdsong darkens.

Meanwhile another man wakes his children
gets them ready, talks to them,
eats breakfast, brings out the car
and drives off with his software company

while the invisible birdsong
forms a helmet around his head
the bee reads the landscape
splashing with honey and air.
