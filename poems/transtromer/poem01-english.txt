Romanesque Arches

In the huge Romanesque church the tourists jostled in the half darkness.
Vault gaped behind vault, no complete view.
A few candle flames flickered.
An angel with no face embraced me
and whispered through my whole body:
"Don't be ashamed of being human, be proud!
Inside you vault opens behind vault endlessly.
You will never be complete, that's how it's meant to be."
I was blind with tears
and pushed out on the sun-seething piazza
together with Mr and Mrs Jones, Herr Tanaka and Signora Sabatini,
and inside them all vault opened behind vault endlessly.
