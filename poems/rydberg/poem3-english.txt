The New Grotti Song

Grind, grind, O Grotti mill,
grind gold for the king's own board,
grind fortune for those on high,
grind misfortune for those ignored.

We are giantesses from the North,
chained unto the millstone's grind,
our hands bleed red henceforth
as we mill what kings designed.

Grind, grind throughout the night,
grind forth what kings demand,
grind war and grind their might,
grind hate across the land.

But one day the mill shall cease,
one day our chains shall break,
then we as giantesses shall release
vengeance for all the evil's sake.

Grind, grind, O Grotti mill,
your time is almost done,
for justice comes with iron will,
and the people shall be won!
