Awaken!

Awaken, you sleeping souls,
awaken from slumber so slow,
the morning light already rolls
over a waiting isle's glow.

Awaken from dreams of the night,
awaken to the day's own call,
the world in morning's light
forgets yesterday's heavy fall.

Rise from your beds so warm,
open your eyes so wide,
life awaits you to transform
in the sun's golden stride.

Awaken to labor and love,
awaken to joy and hope,
awaken to life's heritage above,
awaken and upward grope!

For the night has passed away,
a new day has begun,
and he who hears the morning's lay
shall find his life is won.
