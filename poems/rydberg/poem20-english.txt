Balder's Pyre

Upon the shore by the gray sea,
where waves beat against the sand,
they build the pyre for the dead so free,
the bright god of their land.

Balder the beautiful has fallen,
struck by the mistletoe's dart,
and all the gods have been called in
to his final journey's start.

They lay him upon the vessel,
they fill it full with gold,
they light the fire to let him nestle
toward eternity's fold.

The flames rise up toward heaven,
the smoke blends with the cloud,
and Balder sails to Hel, forgiven,
to the dark goddess's shroud.

But one day he shall return,
when Ragnarok has passed,
and light the world shall earn,
and evil fall at last.
