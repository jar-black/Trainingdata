To Fate

Fate, you mighty power,
that rules over life and death,
you who in each passing hour
determine our joy and our breath.

I have struggled against your hold,
I have tried to flee your hand,
but you find me, truth be told,
wherever I seek my land.

Now I bow my head so low,
not from fear or forced decree,
but because I've come to know
your praise is all life can be.

You teach me to accept
what I cannot change at all,
you teach me to respect
paths I cannot forestall.

So take my hand, o fate,
lead me where you will,
I'll follow through the gate
to life's final still.
