The Wood Nymph

In the deep forest's darkest hall,
where fir trees whisper their eternal song,
there dwells the wood nymph, standing tall,
the fair one who lures the throng.

Her eyes are green as the leaves,
her hair like midnight's sky,
her voice like the brook that weaves
its way through villages nigh.

She dances in moonlight's glitter,
she sings in the night wind's sweep,
and he who sees her sits bitter,
forever bound in her keep.

She is the forest's spirit and soul,
she is nature's mystery,
she binds the lost one whole
and leads him to eternity.

Beware, wanderer, of the wood nymph's call,
let not her gaze you beguile,
for he who follows where her footsteps fall
shall never find his home's own mile.
