Gain and Loss

What have I gained upon my journey,
what have I lost along the way?
I have gained wisdom and learned to see
life's book from day to day.

I have lost the dreams of youth,
the naive hopes I once held dear,
but I have found a deeper truth
about what life is here.

I have lost the ones I loved,
those who went before me to the grave,
but their love continues above
to carry me through every wave.

I have gained moments of happiness,
so pure and bright and clear,
and even if they were but fleeting caress,
they shine in memory's mirror here.

So I weigh gain against loss,
and find that they balance true,
for life gives and takes across,
and all that was, endures anew.
