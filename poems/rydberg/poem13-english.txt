The Flying Dutchman

He sails upon the blackened seas,
the forever cursed captain bold,
his sails are white as graves that freeze,
his crew are shadows, deathly cold.

He seeks a harbor where to anchor,
a land where he may rest,
but the wind drives him ever to hanker
from coast to coast, distressed.

He dreams of love that could redeem,
of a woman who would be his bride,
who dares to risk her life, it would seem,
and break the curse that won't subside.

But centuries pass and no one dares
to sacrifice themselves for his sake,
and the Dutchman sails, no one cares,
on eternal seas, forever awake.

O wanderer on the world's great ocean,
you mirror of humanity's fate,
we all sail with the same devotion,
seeking a harbor before it's too late.
