Cantata

Sing, o heart, sing out your song,
raise your voice to heaven high,
let the melody travel long
over mountain, vale, and sky.

Sing of love that carries through,
sing of hope that never dies,
sing of all that's sacred and true,
sing what the heart implies.

Let your song like waves proceed,
over all the earth so wide,
let it comfort those in need
deep in sorrow's darkest tide.

Sing, o heart, sing out your psalm,
for those who struggle, those who grieve,
give them light and give them calm,
give them solace to believe.

For song is the spirit's wing,
that lifts us toward the sun,
and he who dares to sing
brings hope to everyone.
