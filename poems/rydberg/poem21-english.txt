The Bells

The bells ring in the tower high,
they ring at eve as at morn,
they ring when children are baptized by,
they ring in joy and when we mourn.

They ring when the bride and groom depart,
they ring when the dead are borne away,
they ring when a new year makes its start
and the old fades into yesterday.

Their voices carry through the dale,
over forest, field, and lake,
they speak in metal's singing tale
of life and death for all our sake.

I listen to their ringing sound,
as I have since childhood's day,
and their eternal song resounds
the same as it always has to say.

O bells, you touch my heart so deep,
you wake memories and hope,
you comfort when sorrows creep
and lift my spirit's scope.
