The Raven

The raven sits upon the dead branch,
black against the gray sky,
he watches with eyes that smolder
over the world's desolate lie.

He is Odin's messenger,
he flies between the worlds,
he knows what has been and what shall be,
wisdom's own herald unfurled.

His cry cuts through the silence,
an omen, good or ill,
those who hear it shiver
and read their fate's own quill.

The raven sees death approaching,
he sees the fall of kings,
he sees empires that topple
and hears what nature brings.

Black as night, wise as ages,
the raven watches our earth,
and in his dark feathered plumage
dwell secrets beyond worth.
