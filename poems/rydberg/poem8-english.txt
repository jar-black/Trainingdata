Dream Life

I live two lives, one in the day,
another in the dream of night,
one heavy with worry and dismay,
the other free and light.

In dreams I fly so free,
over seas and mountains and dale,
I visit lands I long to see
and speak with those beyond the pale.

There I meet the departed,
the dear ones who left me here,
they smile, so kindly hearted,
with love they draw me near.

In dreams all things are possible,
the impossible becomes true,
and the heart beats so responsible,
so happy, familiar too.

But morning comes and wakes me,
and the dream flees like the mist,
and I lie beneath the blanket
longing for night's tryst.
