Prometheus and Ahasuerus

Two eternal wanderers meet on a cliff,
Prometheus, chained to the mountain's face,
Ahasuerus, condemned forever to drift
through the world without rest or grace.

"Who are you?" asked the titan in chains,
"You who wander through the ages?"
"I am he who mocked with disdains
him who bore the cross through stages."

"And you?" asked the eternal Jew,
"Why do you suffer on this stone?"
"I gave fire to humankind, it's true,
and the gods punish me alone."

They looked upon each other, the two condemned,
and understood each other's fate so well,
they who forever were contemned
to suffer for humanity's spell.

"We are brothers in suffering," said Prometheus bold,
"we who dared to challenge the high."
And Ahasuerus nodded, so we're told,
we bear the burden without asking why.
