The Elf to the Maiden

Come with me, beautiful maiden,
come to my realm of light,
where flowers never are laden
and night has no darkened blight.

Come with me across the meadow,
across the brook that sings,
to the place beyond the shadow
where eternity rings.

I shall give you crowns of gold,
I shall give you pearls of dew,
I shall give you youth untold
and dance in moonlight's hue.

But the maiden answered sadly:
I cannot follow you,
for my loved ones wait for me gladly,
and my life is here, it's true.

Then the elf vanished in the mist,
with a sigh of longing deep,
and the maiden stood where they had kissed
with memories to keep.
