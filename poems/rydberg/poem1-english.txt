The House-Goblin
by Viktor Rydberg
Translated by Charles Wharton Stork

Midwinter's cold is hard to bear,
The stars are sparkling, gleaming there.
All sleep on the lonely farm
Deep in the midnight calm.
The moon walks her silent way,
The snow shines white on fir trees gray,
The snow shines white on the buildings.
Only the goblin is waking.

There he stands so gray at the stable door,
Gray against the white snowdrifts,
Gazes, as many winters before,
Up at the moon's bright disc,
Gazes toward the forest, where spruce and fir
Draw round the farm a sheltering wall,
Ponders, though it cannot help,
Over a curious riddle.

And from his mind the ancient faith
In dreams itself is pouring:
Shall the weary earth at last
Have enough of pain and toil?
When will summer come and all go well,
So the sun may warm the soul
And the heart of things themselves?
When will all journey and show be done?
And the great lights' love
Shine over earth?

Still is the cottage, each question dumb.
On the little goblin did fall:
The plain lies round the farm so numb,
Dark under midnight's pall,
And in the midwinter moon's cold beams,
There he stands so lone and clean,
Gray against the white snowdrift—
The goblin on the barn keeps watch.
