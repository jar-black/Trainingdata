The Dreamer

He sits beside his window,
the dreamer with vacant gaze,
he sees not the world's shadow,
he sees only his mystic ways.

He dreams of distant lands afar,
of adventure and of gold,
of kingdoms without bar,
of love with no debts to hold.

He builds castles in the air,
he sails across the seas,
he flies with written prayer
that never knows decrease.

The others laugh at him,
they say: He has gone mad!
But he hears not their hymn,
he lives in his own clad.

And when one day he dies,
with the dream within his hand,
he will have lived more wise
than those who never dreamed so grand.
