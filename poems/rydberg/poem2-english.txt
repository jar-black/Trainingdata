The Bathing Children

By the lake's shore in summer evening,
where the water sparkles clear,
the bathing children are playing
with laughter and joy so dear.

They splash in the cool water,
they dive beneath the surface deep,
they swim toward the sunset's daughter
and happiness in them does keep.

Their bodies gleam so white
against the dark blue depth's bowl,
their voices sing free and bright
like birds toward their goal.

I stand upon the shore and watch
that wondrous play out there,
and think of my own youth to match,
of all that once was fair.

O childhood, you pure spring,
you innocence's lost land,
in memory of those bathing children's ring
I find your trace upon the sand.
