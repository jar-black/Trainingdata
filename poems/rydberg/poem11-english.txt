A Flower

I found a flower by the roadside,
so small and so fragile there,
she lit up my spirit with pride
and made the day so fair.

She had no owner to call her own,
she grew free and wild,
no one had planted her, unknown,
but she was wonderfully mild.

I bent down and contemplated
her delicate petals fine,
and in her beauty I located
life's riddle that was mine.

So brief is flowers' time on earth,
so quickly they wilt and fall,
but in that moment of their worth
they shine brighter than all.

So I picked the flower with care,
and carried her home to my room,
and there she stood in her vase so fair
reminding me of life's own bloom.
