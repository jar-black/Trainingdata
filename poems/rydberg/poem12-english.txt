Autumn Evening

Autumn evening descends so still,
the leaves fall down like golden snow,
mist rises by the river's rill
and the moon gleams on the lake below.

It is a time of silence deep,
a pause in time's own way,
when nature rests in peaceful sleep
before winter's long display.

I walk the paths that I have known,
the paths I walked as child,
and memories rise to me alone
of days so bright and mild.

Autumn evening whispers near
of all that's fled and all that's gone,
and in its silent speech I hear
of life's own truth at dawn.

So I stop and breathe in deep,
and let the night surround,
for autumn evening has secrets to keep
that speak without a sound.
