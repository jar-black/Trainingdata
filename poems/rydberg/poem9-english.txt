On the River

I glide in my boat on the river,
between green shores so still,
the water mirrors heaven's shiver,
and time seems to stand until.

The oars dip slowly down,
the sun warms my cheek,
I let my thoughts wear their crown
while drifting, mild and meek.

The river carries me forward,
toward unknown seas and land,
I know not where I'm going toward,
but I trust the water's hand.

So too is life a journey,
on a river we cannot steer,
we're carried toward eternity,
we can only float and hear.

So I glide on slowly,
in my lonely boat's embrace,
and let the river solely
guide me to the final place.
