Snowfrid

Snowfrid, the white maiden fair,
she sleeps in the mountain's hall,
she waits for the champion to dare
to break winter's frozen thrall.

Her face is white as the snow,
her lips are red as blood,
her hair like the ice's glow
on the mountain's frozen flood.

She dreams of the spring to come,
of flowers and birdsong bright,
she waits for the one to drum
her awake from sleep's long night.

Many have sought her dwelling,
many have walked through snow,
but the mountain's path is telling,
and most to their death did go.

But one day the hero shall come,
with courage and love in his breast,
and Snowfrid shall wake to the sun
and become his bride and his rest.
