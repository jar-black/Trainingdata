Whence and Whither?

Whence do I come, whither do I go,
what is the meaning of my way?
These questions plague me high and low,
these riddles night and day.

I come from darkness before,
from the great nothing there,
and I go to what I cannot hear,
to a darkness I've not seen anywhere.

Between these two mysteries
I live my fleeting life,
searching for the theories
that give meaning amid strife.

But perhaps the answer is simpler
than I dare to believe,
perhaps I should be grateful
for the time I receive.

Whence and whither matter less
than what I do right now,
for in the moment's tenderness
lies life's true sacred vow.
