Dexippus

Dexippus, the young Greek,
walks through the temple's hall,
he searches for signs the gods speak
in marble's silent call.

He was a seeker after truth,
a pilgrim on wisdom's way,
his soul was full of burning youth
for life's secret display.

He asked the priest at the altar:
Where dwells eternal truth?
The priest replied without falter:
Within the heart, in sooth.

He asked the sage in the hall:
Where may I find life's meaning?
The wise one answered his call:
Within the question's gleaning.

So Dexippus wandered on,
through life, from year to year,
and truth he sought from dawn to dawn,
he found it in every tear.
