Pastoral

Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la-la!
Now merrily we're dancing!
Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la!
Hold your girl and swing her!

Cows come home through the forest,
cowbells ringing,
summer evening rises from the meadow,
shepherd's song we're singing!

Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la-la!
Fiddler plays at the shieling!
Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la!
Dance in the fragrant grasses!

Moon comes up behind the mountain,
stars are twinkling,
maiden's eyes are gleaming
warmer than all the others.

Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la-la!
Now merrily we're dancing!
Sing the shepherd's song, tra-la!
Summer and youth and gladness!
