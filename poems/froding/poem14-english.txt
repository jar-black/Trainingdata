A Ditty About Love

I love you, my maiden fair,
as the bee loves the flower,
as the bird loves its wings to bear,
as the wave loves the shore each hour.

I love you in the morning light,
I love you in the evening shade,
I love you when the sun shines bright,
I love you when the rains cascade.

Your voice is like a bell that rings
throughout the valley wide,
your laugh is like the summer wind
through leaves where fairies hide.

Your eyes are like the stars that gleam
on midnight's dark blue sky,
your skin is soft as rose petals seem
when morning dew passes by.

I love you, my maiden fair,
with all my heart can give,
and if you love me in return,
a happy man I live.
