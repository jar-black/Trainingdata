Freedom

Freedom, the high, the holy,
that which the soul yearns for,
that which makes us humans live fully,
that which gives us will to explore.

Freedom to think and to speak out,
freedom to go your own way,
freedom to choose without doubt,
freedom to say nay.

But freedom also carries burden,
it demands courage and might,
it demands that you yourself bear the guerdon
of the fate your choices write.

For free is he who dares to fall,
who dares stand by what he does,
who does not crawl before the tall,
who does not silence without cause.

Freedom, the high, the holy,
is not won without fight,
it must be conquered daily
in the struggle against oppression's might.
