A Song-Of-Songs

I dreamed myself to Sharon's vale,
I wandered there in Eden,
I heard the angels' song and tale
and saw the golden freedom.

I dreamed myself in love's embrace,
I kissed the lips of roses,
I whispered my heart's name to trace
in evening wind that closes.

O love, you are the sun of life,
you are the only truth there is,
you sit upon your throne so rife
and rule over thought's abyss.

Let me then die within your arms,
let me dissolve in you,
let me forget my name's own charms
and find you, find you true!

O love, a high and holy might,
o flame of eternity,
with you all words in the world are right,
with you all things agree!
