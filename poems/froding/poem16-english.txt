Rush, Rush, Whisper

Rush, rush, whisper,
wave, wave, beat,
where my sweetheart dwells,
where my longing does meet.

She is fair as the springtime,
gentle as the moon's light,
she is the queen of my heart
in my house, simple and bright.

Rush, rush, whisper,
bear my greeting there,
say that I await her
with a heart laid bare.

Wind, wind, blow now,
fly unto her door,
say that I love her
more than ever before.

Rush, rush, whisper,
wave, wave, beat,
my love is eternal,
though the times deplete.

And one day she'll come here,
and stay here with me,
and the rushes will whisper
of love's path, wild and free.
