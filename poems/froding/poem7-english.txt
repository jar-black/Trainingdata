The Ball

There was dancing down the roadway,
there was dancing in the town,
the fiddler played and played and played
beneath the summer night's gown.

The maidens they were dancing,
the lads were swinging round,
all the feet were tripping
as if night would not be found.

And the moon was shining
on dancing pairs below,
and the night was light as light
as if day would always glow.

There was dancing down the roadway,
there was joy and there was play,
the fiddler played and played and played
and none would go away.

But the sun it rises,
and the dance comes to its end,
and all the little maidens
go home around the bend.
