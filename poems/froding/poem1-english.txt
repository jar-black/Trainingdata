Guitar and Concertina

Joy's own flower is not eternal,
happiness shines but one day,
winds of pleasure blow infernal
from today to today.

But there plays a guitar
and a concertina,
hark, it plays, tralala!
Dance in circles and be glad!

Forget your woe a while, my brother,
swallow sorrow and swing round,
laugh at what life has to offer,
drink your goblet to the ground!

But there plays a guitar
and a concertina,
hark, it plays, tralala!
Dance in circles and be glad!

Death stands waiting at your back, but
he must wait, he must stand,
for tonight's the night to attack, but
for tonight we make our stand!

But there plays a guitar
and a concertina,
hark, it plays, tralala!
Dance in circles and be glad!
