Matrimonial Queries

He said: I want you for my wife,
my only, my dear, my fair!
She said: What can you offer my life?
What home have you to share?

He said: I have a little croft
with field and meadow and wood,
I have two hands that labor oft
and a heart that loves so good.

She said: That's little to offer
a girl with a better mind,
I want silk and velvet to proffer
and golden rings to bind.

He said: Farewell then, my maiden,
I'll seek another bride,
one who will share my burden
and love me without pride.

And she sat there in the parlor
with silk and gold and show,
but her heart was poor and barren
and love she did not know.
