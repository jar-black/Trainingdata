The Wood Sprite

Feel you come from the forest,
feel how the blood rushes,
feel how it grows in the grasses,
hear how the brook gushes!

Wood Sprite stands between the fir trees,
she lures you with her gaze,
she beckons with her fingers
and lips red as wild strawberries.

Go not there, my lad!
She'll dance you astray in the night,
she spins from moonlight and mist
a web to capture your mind.

Her eyes are green as moss,
her hair like needles in autumn storm,
her body white as the birch trunk
in midwinter night's frost.

Go not there, my lad!
For he whom Wood Sprite loves,
he never finds home again,
he wanders the forest forever.
