The Good Old Days

The good old days of yore,
yes, they were good, they say,
when grandfather went to war
and grandmother spun the day away.

Then all was better, people claim,
then folk were honest and good,
then lived we in God's name
and none strayed from where they should.

But I who've read the chronicle
of those old days so dear,
I know that struggles were typical,
and wrong and want and fear.

There were deceivers and there were thieves,
there was oppression and violence,
there were those with cunning that weaves
who drained the blood in silence.

The good old days of yore,
they exist in memory alone,
for time is what it was before,
with good and bad, with good and bad sown.
