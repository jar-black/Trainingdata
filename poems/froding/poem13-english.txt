A Stroll Through the Local Countryside

I walk through my homeland again,
the old pathways feel under my feet,
here I played as a child with my friend,
here I grew from root to complete.

There lies the farm by the river's shore,
there stands the old barn still,
there we hung from the apple tree's store
and dreamed of what life would fulfill.

The fields are green as before,
and the birches whisper in wind,
and the bell in the steeple strikes as of yore
for me and for my mind.

But the faces are new today,
the old ones have gone to rest,
and the children who run in the village, I say,
they know not who I was at best!

Yet I feel at home right here,
though no one recalls my name,
for the land and the forest and meadow so dear
are my childhood's harbor from whence I came.
