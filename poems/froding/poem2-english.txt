Indians

How fine to be an Indian!
To ride across the prairies,
to hunt the buffalo herds
and tear the scalp from your enemy's forehead
and swing it in the wind like a victory banner.

To sit beside your tent in the shadow
and smoke the peace pipe
and crack the bones and eat the marrow out,
and watch the sun sink down
in flames of destruction and blood.

To sleep beneath the stars!
To wake when dawn is breaking!
To hear the birds that sing
and feel the first winds of the day
and find your mustangs on the prairie!

How fine to be an Indian!
Free as the eagle under heaven,
wild as the storm on the prairie,
simple as a child in the realm of dreams,
proud as the mountain's eternal wall!
