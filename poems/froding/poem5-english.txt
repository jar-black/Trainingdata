Our Dean

Our dean always has a word
for the poor farmer in need,
our dean has food at his board
to share with those who lack bread.

Our dean he preaches well
of heaven's kingdom and paradise,
but better are his deeds that tell
when he helps in practical wise.

He doesn't say: Go in peace!
and leave us in our misery,
he takes on life's struggles to cease
and stretches out a helping hand.

Our dean he walks in his coat
the black one from farm to farm,
he gathers his little flock of note
and spreads hope and solace from harm.

And when he stands at the grave's edge
and reads the words of burial rite,
it feels like a steady hand to pledge
that leads us to pastures bright.
