Lovely Weather

Lovely weather, lovely weather,
the sun shines, the sky smiles,
the birds sing, rejoicing together,
all flowers open their petals for miles.

The brook babbles through the dale,
butterflies dance all around,
green grass grows without fail,
and beauty in all things is found.

Children play out on the meadow,
old men sit upon the bench,
old women knit in the shadow,
and sunlight through clouds does drench.

Lovely weather, lovely weather,
let us enjoy this day so bright,
before autumn storms come whether
to break summer's law with their might.

Lovely weather, lovely weather,
life's gift given to us all,
thanks for the sun's light feather,
thanks for each ray that does fall!
