Idealism and Realism

They say: Be a realist!
See the world as it is!
But I am an idealist,
I see what it can give.

The realist sees a tree
and calls it firewood,
the idealist sees a spirit free
that reaches toward heaven's neighborhood.

The realist counts his coin
and weighs every gram,
the idealist seeks to join
the beauty's diagram.

The realist sees a child
and thinks: expenses and trouble there,
the idealist sees, beguiled,
a weave of possibilities fair.

So let me be a dreamer,
let me see the unseen things,
for the world is no worse off
if someone wants it better than it seems.

Idealist I am and shall remain,
until my eyes cease to see,
and perhaps what I pursue in vain
one day reality shall be.
