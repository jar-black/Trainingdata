In Youth

In youth, in the time of youth,
when life shone green and white in truth,
when the heart beat free and uncouth
and the road lay wide ahead.

In youth, when all was new,
when morning came in rosy hue,
when nothing evil yet we knew
and sorrow was so far from dread.

We ran through meadows of flowers,
we bathed in the light of the sun,
we dreamed of golden castles won
and eternal summer hours.

But years pass by, and youth does flee,
and the heart grows heavy as lead,
and we remember the spring that's dead,
the time that never more shall be.

Yet still a spark remains,
a memory of what we were,
a longing for youth's days that stir,
that always in the heart sustains.
