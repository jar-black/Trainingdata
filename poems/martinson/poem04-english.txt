The Seafless Sea

I have seen the seafless sea
without waves and without bottom,
without floor and without shore.
I have seen the seafless sea
in its infinite passage.

It was not water, not mist,
not space and not time,
only an infinite movement
without goal and without source,
the seafless sea's breathing.

I have seen it pass me by
and it carried me along in its passage,
and I knew that I was home
in the seafless sea's embrace,
in its infinite song.
