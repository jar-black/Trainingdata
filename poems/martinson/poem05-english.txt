From Aniara: The Song of Doris

In sleep I hear her,
the sweet, languishing, hovering Doris.
She floats past in a dream of mist,
among sinkholes and whirlpools,
among blue torches she sways past
like a gondola in a Venetian night.

And I want to follow her,
follow her mist-veiled beauty
through the endless spaces,
through the gulf of silent stars,
through the darkness where no words reach,
but she is gone and I awaken.
