Cotton Song

There is a land called Cotton.
There never falls any snow.
There the plantation owners walk
and wring the sweat from their beards.

There the sun shines every day
it even shines at night.
A black man sings by a ditch.
He sings slave blues about his life.

And from his black life's cotton
come the white shirts,
the white sheets in the white houses,
and from his black blues comes jazz.

So he walks on to other ditches
with hoe, spade and seed sack.
And he plants cotton for
the white shirts of the world.
