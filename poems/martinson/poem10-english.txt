Night Violet

Night violet at the meadow's edge,
pale in the summer night,
she smells sweetly in all directions
and wants to be seen by the moon.

She does not wilt from smelling,
she does not age from beauty,
she just stands there pale and fragrant
her only summer through.

Night violet, you sweet flower,
you witness of a night,
you carry in you all summer's memory
and all hushed fragrance.
