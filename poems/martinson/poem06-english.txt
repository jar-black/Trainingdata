Trade Wind

The trade wind comes from the northeast
and blows mild and steady.
He carries with him the salt and the seas
and the memories of the land of palms.

The trade wind whistles in the rigging
and rocks our schooner forward.
He sings of freedom and the sea
and all that we have longed for.

The trade wind, the sailor's friend,
he blows to distant shores.
He carries our dreams on his wings
to lands we have never seen.
