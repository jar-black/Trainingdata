Lullaby for a Man

Sleep now, sleep now, you are too good
for this talk, this nonsense talk.
You don't have time for them.
Sleep now, sleep now, you must go
to brighter land, to mist-free land
with more sun and more true
trust in all of them.

Sleep on your arm.
Night has fallen now.
See how the stars
stand above the roofs.
Sleep in peace, sleep now
while the night prevails.
Dream of light and dream
of the beautiful blue.
