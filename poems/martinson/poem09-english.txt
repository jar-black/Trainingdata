Thousand and One Nights on the Dragon Ship

We sailed eastward
through golden dawns
where the sun rose from the sea
like a red emperor.

We sailed with the monsoons
past Ceylon and Java,
past Sumatra and Borneo,
toward spice scents and porcelain cities.

We were children of the sea,
sailors without home,
with only the horizon
and the night full of stars
as our only compass.
