Poems about Light and Dark

Light carries our words.
Darkness silences them.
Light does not weigh them.
Darkness weighs them.

Light tears the almanac.
Darkness clips the calendar.
Light falls and falls
like a light-driven death.

But darkness gathers and gathers
like the resilience of dim lives.
Light empties our hourglass.
Darkness fills it.
