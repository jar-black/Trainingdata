Wild Bees

I hear the wild bees
in the scent of wild honeysuckle,
in the middle of summer, in the time of roses,
in the wreath of sun and sweetness.

They buzz from flower to flower,
they dance their nectar dance,
they carry on their legs the yellow pollen
to the castle of the bee society.

And I stand there in the glare of sun
and listen to their song,
and the world is full of sweetness
and all that life has.
