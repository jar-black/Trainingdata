From Aniara: In Its Bond

In its bond, in its embrace,
Aniara's, the so-called space sarcophagus,
we drift in the darkness without name,
without goal and without day.

And Mima, our mirror, our comfort,
she shows us images of Earth,
of our lost, green coast
of our lost words.

But the images fade day by day
and soon they will be gone.
Then the night awaits us and the silence
and infinity's sorrowful gates.
