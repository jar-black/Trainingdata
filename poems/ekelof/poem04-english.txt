Samothrace

The god has no arms, the goddess has no head.
Both are only wings.
They strive toward each other through space,
spirit toward spirit, longing toward longing,
and never meet.

It is in this interval we live,
in this void between the wings,
where there is no arrival and no departure,
only the eternal flight, only the eternal
movement toward that which is never reached.
