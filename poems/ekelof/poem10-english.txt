A Mölna Elegy

I was young and knew nothing
and thought I knew everything.
Now I am old and know everything
and understand that I know nothing.

Between these two moments
lies a whole life,
full of mistakes and adventures,
full of love and sorrow.

And if I could live again
I would make the same mistakes,
for it is the mistakes
that make us who we are.
