A Reality (Dreamed)

I dreamed of a garden
full of flowers without names.
I walked there under trees
whose leaves were transparent
and behind every leaf
I saw another garden,
infinitely many gardens
stacked inside each other
like wooden dolls.

And deepest inside, behind everything,
was the garden I sought:
the one that was no longer a dream,
the one that was more real than reality.
