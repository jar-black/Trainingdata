Take and Write

Take and write, says the voice,
write what you hear!
I listen but hear nothing.
Take and write, says the voice again,
write what you see!
I see but see nothing.
Then the voice says for the third time:
Take and write what you are!
And I write:
I am nothing I hear, nothing I see,
I am only this hand that writes.
