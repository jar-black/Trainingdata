Monologue with Its Wife

I have talked to you for years,
and you have never answered.
Still I continue to talk,
for who else would I talk to?

You are my silence
and I am your words.
You are my night
and I am your morning.

So we talk to each other
without ever meeting,
and this is called love,
and this is called life.
