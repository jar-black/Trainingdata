Poetics

To write poetry is to kill time.
The poem lives only in the moment
it comes into being, that is its eternity.
What it says is not important,
what is important is that it says it right now.
And now has already passed.

But in this now that passed
is everything: all words, all dreams,
all memories we never remember,
and in this now that passed just now
you stand reading this.
